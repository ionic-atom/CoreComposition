# Introduction (70%)

### Overview

Hello, Ash and Adam here. We made this game, at first our scale for completion was too large. As we got into the groove of our work flow, there was no way that we were going to be able to finish the original vision. There had to be cuts, we will bring you through what the game ended up being, which we think is pretty cool. One final note before we jump into the game, creating our game has given us a deeper understanding of what was needed from us versus what we thought we had to do. This will be explored later on.

At the farthest view possible, our game is a 2-D, semi top-down, bullet hell. The "story" is centered around not only the player (you) but the bosses. The bosses and the biomes associated with them are the most important part of this game. You must venture through different biomes looking for the bosses causing havoc in this peaceful world of geometry.

The name CoreComposition comes from this games art, focusing on geometrical shapes and how the bosses progress.
